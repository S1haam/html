  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is <b>Sihaam Muuse Ibraahim</b> and I love exploring new skills. <br>
    I enjoy <i>reading</i>, and currently my favorite genre is <u>fantasy</u>. <br>
    I also love <em>going on walks</em> to clear my mind and get fresh air. <br>
    Right now, I am taking a <mark>web development course</mark> to improve my coding skills. <br>
    Although some topics are challenging, I handle them with patience and <small>perseverance</small>. <br>
    I once <del>struggled with HTML</del>, but now I have <ins>gained confidence</ins> in building websites. <br>
    In programming, I sometimes use subscript like H<sub>2</sub>O in examples and superscript like 10<sup>3</sup> for calculations. <br>
    I always try to achieve <strong>strong results</strong> in both my studies and personal projects.
