        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I am a second year Computer Science undergraduate developing my technical skills through degree studies and an ongoing web development course, completed coursework including HTML, CSS and Linux with my progress uploaded to my GitHub. At university I have also worked with racket which strengthened my analytical approach to programming. Beyond academics, I have tutored younger students and served as a Wellbeing Officer, roles that enhanced my ability to support others and contribute to a positive community. Through workshops and part-time jobs, I have led team projects, adapted quickly to fast changing demands and worked with diverse groups to deliver successful outcomes.
